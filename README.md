# ML-Q2-Project

Description: 
Our project enhances the Naïve Bayes classifier by integrating one-dependence estimators with adaptive attribute weighting to mitigate its independence assumption while maintaining efficiency. By integrating a SuperParent Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN) model, we introduce limited dependencies between attributes, and through an Artificial Immune System-inspired weighting mechanism, we dynamically adjust attribute importance based on relevance to the target class. We evaluate our model using a real estate pricing dataset, optimizing key parameters such as the super parent selection metric, smoothing parameter, and attribute weight evolution process. Our experiments aim to balance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the potential of hybrid Naïve Bayes models in handling real-world datasets with interdependent features.
